---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue when using "loading" together with belt direction: "back"

  Changes:
    - Added loading and unloading stations for liquids with a liquid station design that I find compact and "fast" when loading/unloading. Only left or right side is allowed here because I found using "both" sides only decreases loading/unloading time by 33% while it is already very fast when using 2 pumps per wagon.
    - Added a "stacker" so that you can build stackers for variable train length much faster now. Have tested it for trains of length 1-5 with each rotation; so there can still be hidden bugs, but I doubt it. The signals are placed exactly so that trains will fit in the space between signals. For now, the blueprint center is focused around the front end of the stacker. I might add an option of centering the blueprint to the rear of the stacker, or in the middle of it. Limit for stackers is train_length * lanes < 16384 (higher values result in 0.1 ingame fps)
    - The option "green wire connection" now connects chests/storage tanks with the train stop (but the train stop will have no circuit condition set, for now). This way you can instantly set conditions to the train stop to "only be enabled when X amount of items is in chest/storage tank". Also, using "both" sides with chests now connects the left and right side with a wire.
    - Changed default values of some settings: fuel requester chests=on, fuel type=solid fuel normal chest limit=7 (cargo wagon has 40 slots, if you use one-side loading you have 42 chest slots, so inserters will only pick up enough items in the chest to fill one cargo wagon), inserter type=fast inserter, belt type=fast belts, chest type=iron chest, connect everything with green wire=on, use filter inserter=off

Version: 0.0.9

    - Tooltips were changed and rewritten.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Filtered item can now be set to any item (mods with new items included) - click the button with empty mouse cursor to remove filter (useful for when using requester chests and want to request several different items).

Version: 0.0.3
  Bugfixes:

Increased chest-imbalance tolerance for the inserters (so that they keep working when inserter capacity bonus +x is researched).
