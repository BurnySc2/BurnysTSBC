# Update - Mod goes web version
This mod is no longer actively developed. 

Instead, I have made a web version of the mod, so it can be used on Factorio servers that do not run the mod.

The working web version [can be found here](https://burnysc2.github.io/Factorio/Tools/BurnysTSBC/) and should have nearly the same functionality as the mod.

The source code (non-minified) for the web version [can be found here](https://github.com/BurnySc2/Factorio-Scripts/tree/master/BurnysTSBCsource).


# What is this?
This is a [mod](https://mods.factorio.com/) for the game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/).


# What does this mod do and how can I use the GUI?

# Installation
Either start Factorio and look in the mod portal for "BurnysTSBC" and hit download.
A new file zip file will be created in your mod folder (<VERSION> needs to be replaced with the mod version, e.g. 0.1.3):
```
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods\BurnysTSBC_<VERSION>.zip
```

Or download all these files and put them in a subfolder in your mod folder (<VERSION> needs to be replaced with the mod version, e.g. 0.1.3)
e.g.:
```
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods\BurnysTSBC_<VERSION>\control.lua
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods\BurnysTSBC_<VERSION>\data.lua
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods\BurnysTSBC_<VERSION>\info.json
```
